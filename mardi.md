MaRDI, the Mathematical Research Data Initiative, is a German consortium dedicated to advancing the management, accessibility, and reuse of mathematical research data. As part of Germany's National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), MaRDI integrates efforts across various institutions to develop standardized protocols and robust digital infrastructures for mathematical data.

## File Format

Any data that is serialized using OSCAR is encoded using the **mrdi** format. The format specification can be found on [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/12723387) and is described [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-64529-7_25). To learn more about storing data using OSCAR take a look [here](https://docs.oscar-system.org/stable/General/serialization/) or if you would like to extend the serialization to data types that are built from OSCAR types see [here](https://docs.oscar-system.org/stable/DeveloperDocumentation/serialization/#dev_serialization)
